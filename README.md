Prospectus Analysis with Language Models for Indian Initial Public Offerings : Data and Code for ProspectusRoberta

An Offer Document refers to the prospectus containing information about the public offering or offer for sale. This document contains all the information an investor needs to make an informed investment decision. The prospectus is analysed by merchant bankers, stockbrokers, and the investor community to identify various risk factors and answer questions such as: what are the risk factors involved? What are the related party transactions? Where will the money be deployed after listing, etc. All the financial statements prior to the IPO and any legal disclosures are available in the final offer document. This prospectus contains all the pertinent information an investor needs to make an investment decision. The final offer document must be made public before the company can list in the Indian securities market.
Natural language processing, with the advent of large-scale language models, has been implemented in a variety of fields, including legal and biomedical. We intend to apply the same methodology to the IPO.

Our contribution is enumerated below:
• We built a large-scale language model for India's IPO. Our solution based on Roberta will help with a wide range of use cases, such as answering questions, recognizing named entities, and classifying sentences and paragraphs.
• We are also presenting sentence transformers based on our large-scale language model. There are a variety of use cases, including semantic similarity and zero-shot learning.

Pls see data folder for all data.

** We are updating Git Repo with Code.
